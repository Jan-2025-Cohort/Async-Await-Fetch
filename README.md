# Async/Await Joke Fetch Activity

In this activity, you'll practice using `async` and `await` to fetch a random joke from an API and display it on the page when a button is clicked.

## ðŸ§  Learning Goals
- Use `async` functions to handle asynchronous code.
- Use `await` with `fetch()` to retrieve data from an API.
- Handle button click events with JavaScript.
- Display fetched data in the DOM.
- Use `try...catch` to gracefully handle errors.

2. Extract the `setup` and `punchline` from the response.
3. Display the joke in the paragraph tags on the page.
4. Handle any errors using `try...catch` and show a friendly error message.
